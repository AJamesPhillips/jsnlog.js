# JSNLog.js

JSNLog.js is a tiny (2kb min+gz) JavaScript logging library. 
* It has lots of options to reduce the amount of log data, so you get only the data you need.
* It sends log data to the server where you can store it.

* [JSNLog for PHP](http://http://jsnlog.com/phpjs) - PHP handler that receives log data from JSNLog.js and stores it on the server.
* [Open an issue]() if you want to build a server side handler for another language.
